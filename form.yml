      Matlab R2020a Standard contains the core Matlab and some of the most commonly used toolkits. That's the version we recommend. 

      Version R2020a Minimal contains only the core Matlab. It will be a faster to load and it is recommended if you need only the core functionality.

      Version R2020a Full contains all the toolboxes covered by our license. It will be a bit slower to startup, so we recommend to use that only if the toolkit you need is not available in R2020a Standard.

      To get complete details of what toolkits are installed in each version, you can start a session and type the matlab command:<br> *>> ver*
